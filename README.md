## Notes
 - To avoid cutting the connection between files, **only edit the f_.py file**
assigned to you found in **./members_functions**. Thanks!

 - Ms. Julia's streamlit application sample is placed in **./streamlit_sample**.

 - Try running  `streamlit run main.py` to see the base skeleton of our streamlit application

 - To check and run the streamlit application assigned to you, run the command `streamlit run f_**[your name]**.py`
