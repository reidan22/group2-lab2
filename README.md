## Notes
 - To avoid cutting the connection between files, **only edit the f_.py file**
assigned to you found in **./members_functions**. Thanks!

 - Ms. Julia's streamlit application sample is placed in **./streamlit_sample**.

 - Try running  `streamlit run main.py` to see the base skeleton of our streamlit application

 - To check and run the streamlit application assigned to you, run the command `streamlit run f_[your name].py`

 - Here's the usual git command order in **pushing**
    - `git status` -> Check status first to see if you accidentally modified a file out of your scope
    - `git add .` -> to add **all modified files** to stage or `git add [file name]` to only add specific files
    - `git status` -> run this command again to confirm added files to stage. Its color will turn **green** if succesfully added. It's *red* if the file has been modified but hasn't been added
    - `git commit -m "[message]"` -> Always put a commit message. It helps in sorting out and controlling versions of a project
    - `git push [GitHub Repository]` -> Finally, call the push command to transfer all the modified files you added and commited in your git environment for the project to the repo.
